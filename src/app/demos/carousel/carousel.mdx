# Carousel Component

This is a simple carousel-style React component build on top of css scroll snap.

The carousel's state and actions are available via React Context.

## Usage

```Page.tsx
import Carousel, {
  CarouselContextProvider,
  CarouselPagination,
} from "@/components/Carousel";

import slides from "./slides" as {src: string, alt: string}[];

const Page = () => {
    return (
        <CarouselContextProvider>
            <Carousel>
                {slides.map((slide, index) => (
                    <img key={`s${index}`} {...slide} />
                ))}
            </Carousel>
        {/*
            (Optional) controls etc. These could be anywhere
            within the ContextProvider.
        */}
            <CarouselPagination />
        </CarouselContextProvider>
    );
}
```

## Demo

Disable js on this page and you'll see the basic scroll functionality of the carousel still works!

# BBC Interview - Line Management & Coaching

As the principal frontend engineer at Markup I was line manager for most of the frontend developers.

I was heavily involved in:
* hiring
* probationary reviews
* performance improvement plans (where necessary)
* biannual reviews
* promotions
* & would run 1:1s with people on my team

I tried to be approachable and provide useful feedback on PRs.

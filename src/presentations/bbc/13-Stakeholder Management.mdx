# BBC Interview - Stakeholder Management

Working as senior frontend at a agency serving clients in fashion Ecommerce I am extremely familiar with stakeholder management.

The entire process described in the previous slide is an exercise in stakehoder management, a concession to the fact that a 100% agile process is not always compatible with their needs.

The key to stakeholder management, at an agency, is to be able to communicate the value of the process to the stakeholders, and to get them to buy in to the process as much as possible.

We absolutely needed to be on top on any potenital disruptions to deadlines, and be able to communicate the reasons for any delays and work with the clients to either reduce scope on extend the timelines.

It is imperative to maintain a good working relationship with stakehoders, be they product owners or external designers or consultants brought in for a project. These relationships faciliate the process of getting the work done, and are the key to a successful project.

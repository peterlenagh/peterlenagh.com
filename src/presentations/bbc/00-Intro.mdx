    # BBC Interview - Peter Lenagh

    ## Introduction

    I have been working as a senior frontend engineer at Ecommerce agencies since 2013.

    I joined Markup as the fourth employee when they had one client. We grew to over 30 developers across multiple
    clients and my role expanded to Frontend Architect.

    In that role, I was generally responsible for frontend developers and frontend architechtural strategies on our
    platform across clients and would lead frontend teams on the more complex projects.

    Markup's platform was aquired by Astound commmerce in 2022 and I continued my employment there to help facilitate
    the transition.
    I ran workshops and onborading's for Astound's frontend developers joining the project.

    At the end of last year my role was made redundant at Astound, and I'm now looking to join the BBC.

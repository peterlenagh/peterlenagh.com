# BBC Presentation - Planning & Organising

I was often responsible for planning the larger frontend projects at Markup.

This was definitely a learning experience for me. We were working agile but there were regularly requirements for some sort of overarching waterfall plan for larger projects.

The most effective approach, I found, was an **up-front planning an analysis sprint** where we would break a project down into **epics** and those epics into **stories** we thought we could estimate with some degree of certainty.

We'd run estimate sessions where we'd discuss the stories together and get agreement from the team on their apparent complexity.

Next I would, based on the resource avaiable on a project and experience from prior sprints, project a velocity for the sprints & plot these stories out on a gantt chart estimating which sprint they would individually completed in. It makes sense to incluide a buffer at this stage and ensure you're accounting for testing and feedback within your plan.

This let us get an idea of the overall project timeline and also allowed us to plan for any potential blockers or issues that might arise.

It also gave us good (early) insight into how accurate our estimates & projections were, and allowed us to raise any issues with the clients in good time.

Estimates in software engineering are notoriously difficult to get right, and the further into the future you go the less reliable they are, but I found that this approach worked well for us.

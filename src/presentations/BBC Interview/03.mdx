# BBC Presentation - Design & Architecture

> Think about a complex system you have built, designed or worked on.  As part of the interview we'd like you to spend roughly 15 minutes talking us through that system, using a technical diagram tool of your choice.  We will ask questions to clarify our own understanding and also to dig deeper in some areas.

### **Project:** Gant Product Listing Page Redesign & SSR via a standalone SSR service.

- **What non-functional requirements were considered?** The headline non-functional requirements, as touched on already, were to:

    * Deliver the PDP in React (for DX & to support the required level of interactivity)
    * SSR the react app, to ensure we were improving or maintaining performance from both a site speed and SEO perspective.
    * Establish an architechtural pattern for repeating this across pages and clients.

- **What was my role in this project?**

    * I did the frontend analysis & estimates and planning for the project - both redesign & SSR.
    * I liased with the client (designers, product owners, etc) both to do the initial project pland and to keep them abreast of progress and blockers throughout the project and manage expectations.
    * I worked with backend resource on API structures etc.
    * I led the frontend resource on the project.
    * I implemented the more architecturally complex elements (SSR/ App-level components), because they were new to everyone.
    * I specificed the work for other contributors on the frontend and reviewed their work - individual components on the page to satisfy a contract of sorts based on expectations around the props these components would receive and their expected functional and non-functional requirements.

# BBC Presentation - Learning and Continuous Improvement

At Markup, we would host PHP Meetups in the office regulary which I would attend.

I attended conferences and meetups, and arranged for the frontend team to attend Frontend Love conference in Amsterdam.

I regularly watch coureses on frontend masters, and we had paid for access to Frontend Masters for the whole team.

We would also have a biweekly frontend meeting at Markup, which I arranged, where we would discuss what we had been working on, and what we were planning to work on, to facilitate sharing knowlege internally.

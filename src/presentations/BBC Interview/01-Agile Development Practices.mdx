    # BBC Presentation - Agile Development Practices

    I have been working agile since 2012, with varying degrees of rigorous adherence to it's principles.

    I am very comfortable working using the following Scrum rituals:

        * 2 week sprints
        * Daily standups
        * Backlog grooming
        * Weekly estimates sessions
            * Story points to estimate tasks
        * Sprint planning sessions
        * Sprint demos
        * Sprint retrospectives

    I championed this approach at Markup, and we implemented a very similar process with accommodations made for specific clients needs.

    Initially this was seen as overkill for a startup with a small team but as the business grew and team sizes increased we adopted these more and more.

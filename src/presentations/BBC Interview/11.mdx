# BBC Presentation - Conflict Resolution

At Markup, we had an issue at some points with people not being able to work together or contribute positively to the converstaion on PRs.

I would try to lead by example and be helpful and positive in my feedback on PRs. I was also involved in workshops we had to help people communitcate more constrtively.

Tone can be difficult to convey on PRs on occaision so I would often make the effort to speak to someone in person (or on a call) to help them understand my feedback.
